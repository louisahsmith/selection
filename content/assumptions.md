With no additional assumptions, the computed bound for a risk ratio or risk difference will be for general selection bias (Result 1 in [*Smith & VanderWeele 2019*](https://journals.lww.com/epidem/fulltext/2019/07000/Bounding_Bias_Due_to_Selection.7.aspx)). The options correspond to the additional results. 

*Unmeasured factor a defining characteristic of selection*
- $S = U$. This occurs when the factor responsible for selection bias is assumed to be common to the entire selected population (Result 2).

*Selection associated with increased risk of outcome*
- $P(Y=1\mid A=1,S=1)\big/P(Y=1\mid A=1,S=0)$ and $P(Y=1\mid A=0,S=1)\big/P(Y=1\mid A=0,S=0)$ are both greater than 1 (Result 3).

*Selection associated with decreased risk of outcome*
- $P(Y=1\mid A=1,S=1)\big/P(Y=1\mid A=1,S=0)$ and $P(Y=1\mid A=0,S=1)\big/P(Y=1\mid A=0,S=0)$ are both *less* than 1.
  
The first and second or first and third assumptions may also be combined (Result 4).
