With no additional assumptions, the computed bound will be for general selection bias (Result 1 in the [text](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.13402)). The options correspond to the additional results. 

*Unmeasured factor a defining characteristic of selection*
- $S = U$. This occurs when the factor responsible for selection bias is assumed to be common to the entire selected population (Result 2).

*Selection associated with increased risk of outcome*
- $P(Y=1\mid A=1,S=1)\big/P(Y=1\mid A=1,S=0)$ and $P(Y=1\mid A=0,S=1)\big/P(Y=1\mid A=0,S=0)$ are both greater than 1 (Result 3).

*Selection associated with decreased risk of outcome*
- $P(Y=1\mid A=1,S=1)\big/P(Y=1\mid A=1,S=0)$ and $P(Y=1\mid A=0,S=1)\big/P(Y=1\mid A=0,S=0)$ are both *less* than 1.

*Inference only in selected population*
- The parameter of interest is the causal relationship in only the selected population, and not the total population (Result 5).
  
The first and second or first and third assumptions may also be combined (Result 4).
