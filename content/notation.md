# Examples and graphical depictions

The following examples describe how being selected into the study could be related to an exposure and outcome of interest. Since selection bias can often be conceived on as [conditioning on a collider](https://journals.lww.com/epidem/fulltext/2004/09000/A_Structural_Approach_to_Selection_Bias.20.aspx) -- a variable that is directly affected by two (or more) other variables -- we also provide graphical depictions.

For each of these situations, we can either compute a bound for the possible extent of selection bias based on the relationships between the variables, or we can calculate a summary measure -- an E-value for selection bias -- to assess whether it is plausible that our result could be explained by selection bias. Each of these situations is accompanied by a numerical example in [the text](https://journals.lww.com/epidem/fulltext/2019/07000/Bounding_Bias_Due_to_Selection.7.aspx).

## Notation

Throughout, we refer to the exposure of interest as $A$, the outcome (or case-control status) as $Y$, and the fact of having been selected into the study as $S$ (equal to 1 for the selected population and 0 for the non-selected). We refer to the factor(s) responsible for the bias (due to their relationships with exposure, outcome, and selection) as $U$.

It is assumed throughout that any known and measured confounders $C$ have been adjusted for in the analysis. The parameters describing the extent of possible selection bias describe relationships *above and beyond* those factors that have already been included.
