![](post_outcome.png) Another question that has been considered is whether exogenous estrogen ($A$) causes endometrial cancer ($Y$). As an attempt to avoid underdetection of cancer, [one study selected](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM197811162992001?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori%3Arid%3Acrossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%3Dpubmed) only women who had undergone hysterectomy or other diagnostic procedure ($S$). In this case we may consider indication for such a procedure to be $U$. Because estrogen can increase the risk of bleeding or other reason for a diagnostic procedure, as can endometrial cancer itself, women could essentially be selected due to having the exposure *or* the outcome. This could make the two appear to be less likely to co-occur together, and [bias the estimate](https://www.jclinepi.com/article/0021-9681%2881%2990002-3/pdf) toward the null.
