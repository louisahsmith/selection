# Computing an E-value for selection bias

Like the E-value for unmeasured confounding, the selection bias E-value describes the minimum strength of association between several (possibly unmeasured) factors that would be sufficient to have created enough selection bias to explain away an observed exposure-outcome association.

The parameters that the E-value refers to depends on what assumptions an investigator is willing to make, and are printed with the results.
