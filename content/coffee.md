In case-control studies, selection bias can result when the distribution of exposure in the controls doesn't represent the exposure distribution in the source population. For example, the question of whether coffee consumption ($A$) caused pancreatic cancer ($Y$) was considered in a [case-control study](https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJM198103123041102). However, it was later [pointed out](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/361162) that the oversampling of patients with gastrointestinal disorders ($U$) as controls ($S$) could have resulted in a spurious association, as their coffee consumption was likely lower than the general population's due to their illness.
